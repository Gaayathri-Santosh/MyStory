story*

In a spell of dry weather, when the birds could find a very little to drink, a thirsty crow found a pitcher
with a little water in it.

Picking up some small peddbles, he dropped them into the pitcher one by one. 

With each pebble the watr rose a little higher until at last it was near enough to drink.
